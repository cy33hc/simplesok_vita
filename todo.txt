- internet scoring (& solutions?) - check out letslogic.net
- think about some easy way to do a backup of solutions for an entire set
- load names of levels, and display them in the level selection menu as well as in the ingame screen
- playback control? (next/previous/speed control..)
- fix the location of the icon in linux build

- CTRL+V should work also with saved solutions with CTRL+C
- make some tech documentation: id computation, internet levels, xsb format
- add a check for level validity - does a flood fill from player pos goes out?

- DEMO mode (?)
